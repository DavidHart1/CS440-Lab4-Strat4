name: delegate
description: Parent-side procedure for one Strategy 4 delegation - pick the specialist, assemble a complete brief, snapshot the worktree, then check the handoff and confirm no unauthorized files changed. Use before invoking rl-researcher, env-builder, or code-reviewer, or when running the README's smoke tests.

# Delegate one bounded task

Delegation rules live in AGENTS.md and each specialist's limits live in
.claude/agents/. This skill does not restate them; it is the parent's checklist
for applying them to a single task. Skip it for small lookups you can do locally.

## 1. Pick one specialist
- Question about AIMA/RL theory or why something works -> rl-researcher
- Environment plan (or, after a scope update, authorized environment edits) -> env-builder
- Findings on a change that already exists -> code-reviewer
- A task that spans two of these is two delegations. Split it; do not widen one.

## 2. Gather inputs before writing the brief
Specialists have no shell and stop on missing inputs, so collect these first:

| Specialist | Must supply |
| --- | --- |
| rl-researcher | The question; AIMA source paths if definitions are needed; which .claude/context/ note applies, if any |
| env-builder | AIMA source paths (mdp.py, etc.); acceptance criteria; "planning only" or the exact allowed lab4/ edit paths |
| code-reviewer | The diff text, its comparison base, and the changed paths |

For a review, produce the diff yourself and paste it into the brief:

```sh
git diff <base> -- <paths>          # tracked changes
git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all   # list new files; include their contents too
```

If an AIMA path is unknown, ask the user. This checkout does not contain AIMA source.

## 3. Write the brief
Use these five headings and nothing else. Do not paste the conversation or
whole context notes; point to the one note that matters.

```text
Goal: <one sentence>
Inputs: <paths, source references, or the pasted diff + base>
Acceptance: <what a complete answer contains>
Boundaries: <read-only | planning only, no files | edit only: <paths>>
Return: <the handoff shape from the agent's ## Handoff section>
```

## 4. Snapshot, delegate, compare
Take a snapshot before any delegation, including read-only ones. `git diff`
alone misses untracked files.

```sh
snap=$(mktemp); git ls-files -co --exclude-standard -z | xargs -0 shasum > "$snap"
# ... run the specialist ...
git ls-files -co --exclude-standard -z | xargs -0 shasum | diff "$snap" -
```

- rl-researcher / code-reviewer / planning-only env-builder: diff must be empty.
- Authorized env-builder: every changed line must fall within the assigned paths.
- Run independent read-only delegations in parallel, then compare once. Never
  run two delegations that edit at the same time.

## 5. Accept or reject the handoff
Accept only if:
- It matches the Return shape in the brief and stays inside the Goal.
- Claims cite source paths/lines (research) or changed file/line (review).
- A blocker report names the specific missing input. If so, fix that input and
  re-delegate; do not do the specialist's work for it.
- Nothing claims tests passed. If validation is needed, run it yourself (pytest
  in lab4/tests/ once tests exist) and report the real output.

Then integrate the result and make the decision yourself. When findings from two
specialists conflict, check the cited sources instead of picking one.
